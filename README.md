## Hi, I'm Alexandra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end web developer passionate about delivering outstanding web UX. I have 2 years of experience developing responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, JS,  Alpine.js, GreenSock, GitHub, MODX CMS, and Wagtail CMS. 
Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma are also part of my toolbox and help me build webpage prototypes and create visual assets.
