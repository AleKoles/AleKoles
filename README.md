## Hi, I'm Alexandra 👋

I’m a Frontend Design Engineer who bridges the gap between design and implementation. I create responsive, accessible, and visually engaging web experiences — from high-fidelity Figma prototypes to production-ready code. 
My toolset includes: HTML, CSS, Sass, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Alpine.js, React, GSAP, Git, GitHub, MODX CMS, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma.
